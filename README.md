> Observability is the measure of how well a system's internal states can be inferred from its external outputs. It's also the ability to address failures before they happen. Observability needs to be designed.

- Observability needs to be designed.
- It's about past, present and future: `logs`, `metrics` and `alarms.`
- Design is the key.
- `Logging`
  - Detect failures and errors
  - What happened in your project?
  - Design your logs.
  - Avoid mess.
  - Record complimentary information about the errors.
- `Metrics`
  - Performance indicators in live systems.
  - Metrics are not free.
  - Types: business, product, and system.
  - Management and development should collaborate together.
  - Design your metrics.
  - Avoid vendor lock-in.
  - Understand your system.
  - Keep your metrics tidy.
- `Alarms`
  - Come from logs or metrics.
